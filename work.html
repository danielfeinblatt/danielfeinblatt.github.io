            Teaching and tutoring was a meaningful part of my high school experience, which is why I decided to be a tutor for <abbr title="America Reads America Counts">ARAC</abbr>
            last semester. Tutoring in the Durham Public School system, I taught math and reading to fourth grade students and kindergarteners each once a week. Faciliating a positive
            learning environment, reinforcing important fundamentals to help students maintain their confidence in the classroom, and bonding with my young, enthusiastic peers is why
            tutoring was a highlight of both mine and my students' week. Guiding a student from initial confusion with a concept to possessing the confidence to work independently
            is such a fulfilling experience and why I enjoyed tutoring so much.

            Working as a crew member at Jersey Mike's over the summer before leaving for Duke was a valuable experience. Starting out just cooking hot sandwiches on the grill, I quickly
            grew by learning and obtaining certifications in four additional positions. Soon I was preparing every type of made-to-order sandwich offered, baking bread,
            prepping ingredients, stocking inventory, sanitizing containers, and manning the register. Interacting with all types of customers and new situations almost every day,
            I improved my adapation skills and ability to handle adverse situations in a calm manner. Every employee's dedication to the company's core values of Desire for Growth,
            Integrity, Compassion, Servant Leadership, and Positive Attitude made being a member of the crew a notable growing experience.

            As a nationally licensed soccer referee, I officiated competitive youth soccer matches up to players <abbr title="Age group of players 21 and younger">Under-21</abbr>. Working
            alongside two fellow referees each weekend during the regular season, refereeing up to five games in a day, and three referees during tournaments, refereeing up to 12 games in a day,
            I developed key collaboration and communication skills to ensure a safe, fair playing environment. Managing coaches, spectators, and sometimes even players who were older
            than me, I learned how to exert my authority on the field in a commanding, respectful manner to keep the game under control. Reading the speed, intensity, and other
            aspects of the game and adapt accordingly was an essential skill I continually improved upon and is relevant well beyond the bounds of the soccer field.

            In just my first year at Duke I have already grown and learned so much and am excited for all the still is to come in my next three
            years. I planned on majoring in Mechanical Engineering coming to Duke, but discovered my true passion in circuits, computers, and coding
            and instead am double majoring in <abbr title="Electrical and Computer Engineering">ECE</abbr> and <abbr title="Computer Science">CS</abbr>.

            High school is where I began discovering many of my passions. From working on smaller projects, like building a chair capable of supporting the average adult using just a
            limited supply of cardboard, in my engineering classes to massive projects, like an a 18-foot-tall trebuchet or a mutlifunctional robot, as a four year member (and two
            year vice president) of my school's <abbr title="Technology Student Association">TSA</abbr>, I developed my love for engineering. Playing varsity ice hockey all
            four years, I grew my love for the game, giving my best on and off the ice to improve myself and my team. The Daughters of Israel Integenerational Service Program, a student-run
            program that paired students with senior senior citizens to facilitate meaningful conversation and intergenerational friendships, was a significant part of my high school experience,
            participating as a freshman and progressing to be the president by senior year. Volunteering with this program, as a tutor, and at the
            <abbr title="United Service Organizations">USO</abbr> helped me discover my passion for community involvement and service. These experiences built a strong foundation for me
            to build upon and inform many of my current involvements at Duke.

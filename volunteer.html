            Until CoViD-19 caused the unforunate but necessary cancellation of all DukeEngage programs, I was accepted and eagerly awaiting this summer, where I would
            have been participating in DukeEngage's program in Vietnam. The two month service-learning project in Quang Tri, Vietnam had to main components:
            building infrastructure for a rural community and teaching English to Vietnamese students in a local school. It was truly the perfect program
            for me, as it combined my love of building and engineering with my passion for tutoring and teaching. Having already attended a preparation course
            for the program, I was disappointed when the program was officially cancelled. But setbacks often shed light on new opporunities, and in this case
            my role as a __________ at ________ through the Phoenix Project is a perfect example of this.

            It is so easy to take for granted the freedom and safety we have in America because of the military service members who dedicate their lives to protecting us.
            It is so important that we support and show our appreciation for these brave men and women, which is why I became a <abbr title="United Service Organizations">USO</abbr>
            volunteer, serving active and retired military members in their travels. Providing hospitality services and information, I ensure the USO center is a clean, comfortable,
            and welcoming place for our service members to relax and feel appreciated. From cadets attending West Point to parents with young children to retired service members who
            served for 20 years, the people I meet while volunteering are some of the most genuine and truly inspiring. They are why being a USO volunteer is so meaningful to me.

            As a volunteer tutor, I served as a resource for my fellow high school students who were struggling in their math or science classes. Tutoring during lunch and after
            school, I acted as a resource for students to ask questions, receive help understanding topics, and develop positive studying and test-taking habits. The reason I enjoyed
            tutoring so much was the students who were truly remarkable. When they struggled, they actively sought help and voluntarily put in the extra time needed to succeed
            rather than simply giving up. Each one possessed the motivation but just needed a little guidance and providing that for my peers was an amazing experience.

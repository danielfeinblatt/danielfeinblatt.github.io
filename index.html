          Wanting to get involved in research early on, I contacted my ECE 110 professor Dr. David Smith to inquire about his lab work.
          A few weeks later I began my job conducting research in his lab. As a first-year with little knowledge going in,
          I saw it as an incredible opportunity for experiential learning and growth. Since I began in March 2020 working under
          the guidance of Dr. Jonah Gollub, every day has been filled with unfamiliarity which, although confusing at times, offers an
          exciting resource of uliminated learning. Although CoViD-19 has thrown a wrench in everyone's schedules, I have continued my
          research from home, currently utilizing Python, Unity, and C# as I investigate a positional tracking system for use with the
          metamaterial imager being developed in the lab.

          As my first involvement in research, I spent the summer working full time in NJIT's Biophysics lab under Dr. Camelia Prodan.
          Familiarizing myself with the setting and learning how to conduct research, I enjoyed the exploratory nature of the laboratory
          and constant opportunity for learning. Throughout the research internship my focus was: Determining and Analyzing Waves and Gaps
          in Two-Dimensional Wave Tanks Containing Select Patterns. With the conclusion of the internship, I wrote a report detailing my
          discoveries and contributions and presented to faculty and my peers. ADD LINKS TO THESE!!!

          In just my first year at Duke I have already grown and learned so much and am excited for all the still is to come in my next three
          years. I planned on majoring in Mechanical Engineering coming to Duke, but discovered my true passion in circuits, computers, and coding
          and instead am double majoring in <abbr title="Electrical and Computer Engineering">ECE</abbr> and <abbr title="Computer Science">CS</abbr>.

          Until CoViD-19 caused the unforunate but necessary cancellation of all DukeEngage programs, I was accepted and eagerly awaiting this summer, where I would
          have been participating in DukeEngage's program in Vietnam. The two month service-learning project in Quang Tri, Vietnam had to main components:
          building infrastructure for a rural community and teaching English to Vietnamese students in a local school. It was truly the perfect program
          for me, as it combined my love of building and engineering with my passion for tutoring and teaching. Having already attended a preparation course
          for the program, I was disappointed when the program was officially cancelled. But setbacks often shed light on new opporunities, and in this case
          my role as a __________ at ________ through the Phoenix Project is a perfect example of this.

          It is so easy to take for granted the freedom and safety we have in America because of the military service members who dedicate their lives to protecting us.
          It is so important that we support and show our appreciation for these brave men and women, which is why I became a <abbr title="United Service Organizations">USO</abbr>
          volunteer, serving active and retired military members in their travels. Providing hospitality services and information, I ensure the USO center is a clean, comfortable,
          and welcoming place for our service members to relax and feel appreciated. From cadets attending West Point to parents with young children to retired service members who
          served for 20 years, the people I meet while volunteering are some of the most genuine and truly inspiring. They are why being a USO volunteer is so meaningful to me.

          Teaching and tutoring was a meaningful part of my high school experience, which is why I decided to be a tutor for <abbr title="America Reads America Counts">ARAC</abbr>
          last semester. Tutoring in the Durham Public School system, I taught math and reading to fourth grade students and kindergarteners each once a week. Faciliating a positive
          learning environment, reinforcing important fundamentals to help students maintain their confidence in the classroom, and bonding with my young, enthusiastic peers is why
          tutoring was a highlight of both mine and my students' week. Guiding a student from initial confusion with a concept to possessing the confidence to work independently
          is such a fulfilling experience and why I enjoyed tutoring so much.

          As a volunteer tutor, I served as a resource for my fellow high school students who were struggling in their math or science classes. Tutoring during lunch and after
          school, I acted as a resource for students to ask questions, receive help understanding topics, and develop positive studying and test-taking habits. The reason I enjoyed
          tutoring so much was the students who were truly remarkable. When they struggled, they actively sought help and voluntarily put in the extra time needed to succeed
          rather than simply giving up. Each one possessed the motivation but just needed a little guidance and providing that for my peers was an amazing experience.

          Working as a crew member at Jersey Mike's over the summer before leaving for Duke was a valuable experience. Starting out just cooking hot sandwiches on the grill, I quickly
          grew by learning and obtaining certifications in four additional positions. Soon I was preparing every type of made-to-order sandwich offered, baking bread,
          prepping ingredients, stocking inventory, sanitizing containers, and manning the register. Interacting with all types of customers and new situations almost every day,
          I improved my adapation skills and ability to handle adverse situations in a calm manner. Every employee's dedication to the company's core values of Desire for Growth,
          Integrity, Compassion, Servant Leadership, and Positive Attitude made being a member of the crew a notable growing experience.

          As a nationally licensed soccer referee, I officiated competitive youth soccer matches up to players <abbr title="Age group of players 21 and younger">Under-21</abbr>. Working
          alongside two fellow referees each weekend during the regular season, refereeing up to five games in a day, and three referees during tournaments, refereeing up to 12 games in a day,
          I developed key collaboration and communication skills to ensure a safe, fair playing environment. Managing coaches, spectators, and sometimes even players who were older
          than me, I learned how to exert my authority on the field in a commanding, respectful manner to keep the game under control. Reading the speed, intensity, and other
          aspects of the game and adapt accordingly was an essential skill I continually improved upon and is relevant well beyond the bounds of the soccer field.

          High school is where I began discovering many of my passions. From working on smaller projects, like building a chair capable of supporting the average adult using just a
          limited supply of cardboard, in my engineering classes to massive projects, like an a 18-foot-tall trebuchet or a mutlifunctional robot, as a four year member (and two
          year vice president) of my school's <abbr title="Technology Student Association">TSA</abbr>, I developed my love for engineering. Playing varsity ice hockey all
          four years, I grew my love for the game, giving my best on and off the ice to improve myself and my team. The Daughters of Israel Integenerational Service Program, a student-run
          program that paired students with senior senior citizens to facilitate meaningful conversation and intergenerational friendships, was a significant part of my high school experience,
          participating as a freshman and progressing to be the president by senior year. Volunteering with this program, as a tutor, and at the
          <abbr title="United Service Organizations">USO</abbr> helped me discover my passion for community involvement and service. These experiences built a strong foundation for me
          to build upon and inform many of my current involvements at Duke.

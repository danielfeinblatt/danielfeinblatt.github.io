            Wanting to get involved in research early on, I contacted my ECE 110 professor Dr. David Smith to inquire about his lab work.
            A few weeks later I began my job conducting research in his lab. As a first-year with little knowledge going in,
            I saw it as an incredible opportunity for experiential learning and growth. Since I began in March 2020 working under
            the guidance of Dr. Jonah Gollub, every day has been filled with unfamiliarity which, although confusing at times, offers an
            exciting resource of uliminated learning. Although CoViD-19 has thrown a wrench in everyone's schedules, I have continued my
            research from home, currently utilizing Python, Unity, and C# as I investigate a positional tracking system for use with the
            metamaterial imager being developed in the lab.

            As my first involvement in research, I spent the summer working full time in NJIT's Biophysics lab under Dr. Camelia Prodan.
            Familiarizing myself with the setting and learning how to conduct research, I enjoyed the exploratory nature of the laboratory
            and constant opportunity for learning. Throughout the research internship my focus was: Determining and Analyzing Waves and Gaps
            in Two-Dimensional Wave Tanks Containing Select Patterns. With the conclusion of the internship, I wrote a report detailing my
            discoveries and contributions and presented to faculty and my peers. ADD LINKS TO THESE!!!

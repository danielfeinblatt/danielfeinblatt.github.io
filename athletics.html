          <p>
            Representing Duke on the ice is an honor and privelege for me. Practicing and playing games throughout both the spring and fall semesters,
            I love the commitment, dedication, and comradery that the whole team shares. Over this past winter break we had the incredible experience
            of traveling to London, England to compete on the ice and explore the city as a team. My teamates and their passion both on and off the ice
            are why I am so proud to be a member of the team. <a href="#">Click here</a> to see some pictures from London.
